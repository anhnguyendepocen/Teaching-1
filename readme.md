# Teaching: Statistical Tools for Data Science
The repository contains the material I used while teaching the practical sessions of the course "Statistical Tools for Data Science" in the University of Grenoble-Alps.
The course took place during October-November 2016. A wiki containing the description of the topics discussed in the course is [here](http://ama.liglab.fr/OutilsStatistquesDS/index.php?title=Accueil)


## Practical Sessions Description
1. Supervised Learning: Intro to Python,  Implementation of the perceptron classifier.
2. Unsupervised Learning for clustering: Implementation of k-Means
3. Text Mining: The Vector Space Model and feature extraction for text
4. Probabilistic Models: probabilistic Latent Semantic Allocation 
5. Probabilistic Models: Latent Dirichlet Allocation with collapsed Gibbs sampling inference 

## Material
The directories Session1 to Session5 contain the Jupyter Notebooks used for each session.
